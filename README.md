# Microstrip-Antenna-for-5G-Applications
This repository includes the design and simulation files for a microstrip patch antenna intended for 5G communication applications. The design, developed during my summer internship, operates at the 27.94 GHz frequency band and was simulated using Ansys HFSS to explore high-frequency antenna design optimized for 5G applications.
